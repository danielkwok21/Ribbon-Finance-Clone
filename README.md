## Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `docker-compose up` in terminal
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ 


## Technical remarks
1. Frontend is built with React + Typescript + MUI (UI component library)
2. Backend is built with Nodejs + Express + Typescript
3. Coingecko api (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) was used to display coin price fluctuations

## Learnings
1. How to use Typescript (It's mindblowingly awesome. Increased my code confidence by 10x)
2. How to use coingecko api
